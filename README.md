This code was written by [BARTHE Guillaume](https://github.com/Guillaume-Barthe/) and is linked to a paper you can read in the pdf document called paper.pdf. This work is based on the CycleGAN model created by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and the link to his repository is [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/) 

## Horse2zebra implementation
