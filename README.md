# Covid-Xray-GAN
Generating fake images of covid X-ray to augment the size of the database

This code was written by [BARTHE Guillaume](https://github.com/Guillaume-Barthe/) and is linked to a paper you can read in the pdf document called paper.pdf. This work is based on the CycleGAN model created by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and the link to his repository is [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/) 

## Horse2zebra implementation

If you want to take a look at the cycleGan model applied to Horses and Zebras, the parameters I used to produce the results of the paper and the output images are on this [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Guillaume-Barthe/Covid-Xray-GAN/blob/main/CycleGAN_horses.ipynb).

## Covid-19 Xrays implementation

The adaptation to the Covid-19 dataset was also implemented on Google Colab and can be found on this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Guillaume-Barthe/Covid-Xray-GAN/blob/main/CycleGAN_horses.ipynb).
